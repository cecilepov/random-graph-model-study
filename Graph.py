"""
This module provides a simple class implementation for undirected graphs.

A graph is a data structure composed of vertices and edges.
It also provides features computation for network analysis.

Typical usage example:
    vertices = [0,1,2,3]
    edges    = [[0,1],[2,3],[0,3]]
    my_graph = Graph(vertices, edges)
    my_graph.get_connected_components()
